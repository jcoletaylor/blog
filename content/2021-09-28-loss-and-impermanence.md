## Loss

A second friend of mine killed herself this month, following closely on the sudden loss of the first. A third, as close to my heart as a brother, walks close to that same edge still, as I write this - he is isolating, pulling away, and I am concerned.

I had come to know the first - James, a brilliant poet and historian - as we stood shoulder to shoulder, lined up in the streets, rallying and holding the line against white supremacists. We joined these lines together more than once, sometimes marching against hate, against war, and for an economic and ecological system based in compassion, in justice. We exchanged letters and essays, editing and critiquing for one another, in public and private words echoing time and again the value of each life, with what Liberation Theology might call a “preferential option” for the poor, the marginalized, especially standing over these last years for the indispensability and vital importance of Black Lives.

The second friend, Dakota, was a passionate and talented young artist - on fire for compassion as a political force, lending her art and her voice, in spite of, or perhaps simultaneous with, her own struggles. She held nothing back. Holding nothing back, giving everything they had and pouring it all out - a trait that united them both, though I don’t believe they even knew one another.

Loss. Where are they, in this very moment of Life-Death?

## Impermanence

It is Autumn, the light grows shorter, and reminds of the cycles of the seasons, as they come, flourish, and fade. Our breath likewise expands, contracts, expands again. So too the beat of our hearts, and the shape of our lives - contraction and expansion, coming and going, living and dying. Each in their own unique harmonies, finding cadence with even patterns as seeming distant and the slow turn of tectonic shifts, or the rise and fall of solar storms and flares, far beyond the common reach of day-to-day perception, but no less constitutive of our food and drink, our waking and sleeping, of everything that, as Thich Nhat Hanh might describe, makes up our inter-being. In the grand sweep of galaxies winking out eons before their light arrives, small and twinkling through the atmosphere; in the turn of the seasons; in the wisdom of the moment of just this breath - in, and out. In these, of course, we can perceive impermanence, and even find awe in the thoroughgoing and all-pervading nature of change.

Perhaps in its own way this grand sweep of impermanence offers solace, a way of appreciating the nature of our brief lives in the context of constant and unrelenting change. But my heart still aches.

The Heart Sutra, in its few succinct lines, points us clearly to the nature of Emptiness - or, if we prefer, empty-fullness - where all concepts fail, where they do not hold. Not born, not destroyed, no loss, no gain - no time or distance, no inside or out, none of the constraints we might put in place to give stable shape to this One, vast and void, intimate Heart. In this great vast and void there is no living and dying, nothing separate to live and die, no grand shape of the cosmos, no small, human lungs to breathe in and out.

No separation at all. No separate James who suffers relapse and DUI, whose heart breaks at a sense of having let down those he loves. No separate Dakota who could not see a way out. No separate Pete to mourn them. And yet, Loss! Heartache. The one who cries out, and the one who hears, are not two - these numberless hands and eyes of Kannon.

I would like to quote here at length from an excerpt of a [story of Satsujo](https://zenstudiespodcast.com/grief-in-buddhism-1/).

> An 18th century story about Satsujo, a student of the famous Rinzai master Hakuin, offers us a very different Buddhist message about grief (this is from the book The Hidden Lamp: Stories from Twenty-Five Centuries of Awakened Women):
>
> “When Satsujo, a great disciple of Hakuin, was old, she lost her granddaughter, which grieved her very much. An old man from the neighborhood came and admonished her: ‘Why are you wailing so much? If people hear this, they’ll all say, “the old lady once studied with Hakuin and was enlightened, so now why is she mourning her granddaughter so much?” You ought to lighten up a bit.’
>
> “Satsujo glared at her neighbor and scolded him: ‘You baldheaded fool, what do you know? My tears and weeping are better for my granddaughter than incense, flower, and lamps!’
>
> “The old man left without a word.”
>

Satsujo pours herself our completely, nothing held back. Tears and wailing - just this very life, in its fullness. Her grief shows herself fully, her most natural, alive, and awake self - a wholehearted grief. She holds nothing back, and she reminds me of James, of Dakota, as I knew and know them, the intense vitality of a life lived in giving everything they had at every moment, in every way they knew.

## Wholehearted

Dogen’s *Bendowa* can be translated as *A Talk on the Wholehearted Practice of the Way*, though in the copy I have with commentary by Kosho Uchiyama Roshi, it has simply been entitled *The Wholehearted Way*. This choice for translation of the essence of *Bendowa* has been a constant reminder for me in practice. Something about it strikes me as critical for engaging with each day, each moment, exactly as it is, without any pretense, without any clinging to concepts or memories of the experience of Emptiness - nothing to let us pretend to be anything other than deeply, intimately human. To live wholeheartedly in the midst of that imperfect, step-by-step walking of the Way.

This Wholehearted Way first enjoins us to practice just like this - wholeheartedly, with nothing held back of ourselves - a willingness to pour ourselves out completely in each moment. When grieving, grieve. When wailing, wail - Satsujo pours herself out with us.

But coupled with this is an inescapable call to witness that Way is always Wholehearted, and cannot be other than a full expression of precisely this One Fact, this very moment. Confused is the Way, wholeheartedly confused. Uncertain is the Way. Hurt and angry and full of grief and wishing that those we love could find a way not to suffer - this, too, is the Way.

For me, this is the Vow to save all beings. To walk together, not as something outside, above, or wiser than, but intimately, wholeheartedly together, in our joys, in our fears, in our celebrations and our confusions. It is this fact, the simple inescapable fact that the Way cannot be fallen out of, cannot be sidestepped, will never find us lacking and leave us somehow abandoned, but instead is precisely our lives even in our confusion - this is, for me, the true Heart of the Bodhisattva’s Vow. This Great Way that is our very breath, the very step by step walking of the path, whether that path is Loss or Joy, this heartache of a missing friend, this grief at being unable to have shared or lifted their burden - this is the Vow that animates our walking of the Way, our Vow to set endless heartache to rest. Satsujo pours herself out in tears and wailing, and the whole great wide earth pours itself out in kind, one Heart beating everywhere. We pour ourselves out. I pour myself out. This Wholehearted Way, no trace anywhere of anything separate to be other than this one Heart pouring itself out.

Loss is intimate. Our heartbreak is this one Heart Broken, infinitely personal and specific, and without a hairsbreadth of a gap, one with the beating of each broken heart. Of our broken hearts. James’ voice speaks these words. Dakota’s fire rushes my phrases and I stumble to keep up, in fits and starts and pauses. Completely alive, right here and right now, and already gone, from the beginning.

An ache in the chest. Gutei holds up a finger and gives life to the world. Joshu breathes out Mu and the earth shakes, falls away, nothing remaining. Buddha holds up a flower, precious and unique and unrepeatable. The preciousness of each one, in its most precise and specific. Exactly each one, precious beyond measure. And already gone, from the first, completely gone. And so too for this aching loss - precious beyond measure.
