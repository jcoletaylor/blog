## Three Poems

-----

```
Passed through a dark place
On a hill, where the tree shadows stretched out long, deep
Crisp at the edges, beneath a bright moon
Early enough in the morning that it was still night
And was gone
Walked through, nothing at the other side but footsteps
But was not behind in the shadow, either
Just thoughts and leaves together scattered by the wind
Stars in the eyes and a rustling sound
A thicket of thorns and roses
```

-----

```
Vine twists at the base of my skull
Thorns blight my right eye in the socket
A rose blooms at my left
Rich red deep almost purple
Alight with dreams, visions
And all that is dark to reason
```

-----

```
In the park, well-worn footpaths through the trees
The woods but not deep, sounds of cars in the distance
But the light is lower
And the warmth of the summer hanging on into autumn
The light has changed but the humidity still clings
Thoughts heavy with the warmth, the insect sounds

Walking and beginning to lose myself
And lose where this is
Realizing with a gentle suddenness that the trees, the woods, the paths
Let us through, but could
In a moment
Open up a new path where maybe it was not before, or just had not seen

And with steps just a few away the car sounds would fade
And the light would grow lower, richer
With more shadows and movement
Some doorway unnoticed of vines and flowers and tangled branches
And in the Deep now
Like a dream that unfolds beneath footsteps
```
