## Brief Thoughts on Mystery in Fiction

Been giving myself space to read things that I might not normally. After being in the hospital and trying to recover, I’ve taken to reading fiction at night before bed with far more consistency than I have in years. It’s been pleasant, but simultaneously it has given me a chance to reflect on what draws me into, and back to, a narrative. I’ve realized that I will read things that are, objectively, kinda bad, if the central mystery is compelling. If I feel like there’s something turning at the center that I want to understand, experience, or discover. It genuinely helps if there are characters I enjoy, of course. But I will wade through questionable characterization, sub-par dialogue, and cringey inner monologues if it means making progress toward discovering some mystery turning at the heart of the narrative.

Series and serials require better characterization. There’s no reason to keep coming back to a series or serial that has poor characters and poor character interactions. There are generally no long-running shared mysteries in a series or serial, and if there are, they tend to be prosaic and ultimately fall flat, because they have been stretched for longer than natural tension or interest of discovery will hold, or they are elevated to a quasi-mythical status in the narrative landscape, so that by directly encountering them, the whole of the prior narrative is trivialized, no matter how it is handled.

Mystery tends to be more narratively compelling when we have less clear a sense of what is real, what the boundary conditions for a given world might be, so that we are consciously or unconsciously open to the irruption of something truly Other into the experience of both the reader and the characters.

This can be in tension - sometimes productive, sometimes simply antagonistic - with the impulse to build a cast of characters who interact well with one another, who know each other enough to speak in candid and clear ways, that lead to more engaging dialogues and partnerships. If characters share with each other, if they engage in a kind of informal reality testing and boundary establishment around the core mystery, then the looming uncertainty of the central mystery begins to be constrained and given more precise parameters. This is not bad, but it means that we are solving a mystery in a way akin more to a detective novel - we will find a specific culprit or a specific source, and we usually end up in a “race against time” to find and stop them, to avert a tragedy, or to save someone from their fate. This allows us to show our cast of characters working together against difficult odds, coming to know themselves and one another better. This can absolutely work, but you need to be clear that this is the kind of mystery you are trying to approach - one that can be solved, not only engaged with. The Other becomes more along the lines of an antagonist or even just a conflict of time and events, rather than something nameless.

The counter-side to this can be characters who always seem to know more than they let on, characters who speak in riddles or half-truths, who are somewhat “above” the struggle of the narrative. While those can have their place, I find them to be often a tired and over-worn trope. If the mystery is deep (and isn’t an obvious reveal of “oh look, magic *is* real!”), then having characters who know but won’t share their information becomes questionable - they cannot be partners, at the least, with the other principal protagonists. For them to exist and not feel like a fairy godmother, they have to have their own interests, their own purposes, and narrative reasons, if not explicit to the other characters, for their unwillingness to engage.

Fairy tales are unique - or at least in a shared space with other kinds of hauntings - in that the central mystery can be interacted with, come into contact with, but not resolved, not “found out”, and not stopped. The mystery can be brushed up against and be shown to have real effects, but does not lend itself to simple resolution. Fairy tales have us encounter a Mystery and we leave changed, as characters and readers alike, but this encounter does not resolve or lessen the strangeness and otherness of the mystery itself. We are not as readers, nor are the characters, given the opportunity to arrive at any kind of “possession” of the mystery, even as formal knowledge. We can have an experience of that mystery, we can see it change the world, but we cannot take hold of it and say “and now this is mine, I know it thoroughly”.
