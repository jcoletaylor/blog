## Which Side Are You On

Socialism or Barbarism, as the old cry goes. But let's say it clearly, in terms that are specific to our time: it will be socialism, collapse, or eco-fascism. Those are the only options ahead of us.

COVID-19 has made it clear that capitalist responses to systemic and global problems are cripplingly inadequate. They would be laughable if so many people weren't at risk. Millions of workers have suddenly lost their jobs, and with it their healthcare. The sick who could have been spared their illness were not, due to completely inadequate preparation and planning.

Neo-liberal and privatize-everything ideologies pushed from the highest levels of government have shown themselves to be empty of any meaningful response to the situation in which we find ourselves. They do not have solutions, and have shown themselves complicit in the exploitation and negligent abandonment of the most vulnerable.

Structural, complete system change is the only answer. No more calls for reform. No more calls for reigning in the excesses and failures of capital with uncoordinated bits of legislation, slap-on-the-wrist fines, and lobbyist-backed loophole filled language.

Start with Medicare for All, stop tying healthcare to employment, and go bigger - Nationalize the entire healthcare system.

Start with the bold plans of a Green New Deal, and go bigger still - Nationalize all major sectors of industry and commerce.

Start with an end to all student debt, medical debt, housing debt, and think bigger, to a complete debt jubilee for working people. Nationalize the banks, and institute a nationwide living wage, and ensure income for the vulnerable, those unable to work. End homelessness - take all empty and unused housing into public ownership and open them to all public need.

Keep people working. Being out of work because the anxieties of the rich have sent the DOW and S&P into a plummet should not mean a halt to our mutual productive capacity. Put workplaces under direct worker control and have us be mutually accountable to local, regional, national, and international bodies of other workers, duly elected and immediately re-callable, to coordinate economic and social efforts at all levels, for the good of all.

We can do these things. And we must do them, and we have to do them now.

There will be other answers circulated. Closed borders. Vilifying along racial and class lines. As people wake up to the urgency of climate change, as the critical failure of our current economic and political systems to respond to a global pandemic like COVID-19 shows them to be hollow and void of solutions for problems at this scale, there will be calls to the most crass nationalism, including at first subtle but increasingly clear calls for ethnic nationalism. It will be couched in ecological terms. Rather than finding fault with capitalism, with the rule of the wealthy, with the exploitation of the workers by the powerful, it will find fault with ethnic groups, with the poor, with the already marginalized. And they will quickly draw the wealthy and powerful to them. Fascism will find a voice louder and more full-throated than ever. We are already seeing it.

Either we work toward a more just world, a world that looks to the needs of us all, or we go down a very dark road. It's socialism, collapse, or fascism.

I know what side I'm on, red flag waving high. As the old song goes, which side are you on?
