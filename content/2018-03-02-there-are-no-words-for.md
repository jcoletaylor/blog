There are no words for what my heart sings to be  
There is not a name for the living, striving, growing  
In my chest and from my guts and rising up from the curl of my toes in the dirt  
Not shaman but like it  
Not priest but not unholy  
Just the greens and golden sun through trees and the wild taste of springtime breezes, and the dark colors of tree bark that are neither brown nor gray exactly  

There isnâ€™t anything even left of me  
Nowhere to mark me out and find me  
I am only the breeze and the branches gently swaying against the sky  
I am the fresh green of the grass  
Where there is no center, nothing at the core to say here I am  
Only a boundless freedom of living growing moving dying  

No words or even hope of other  
And when the longing calls out in me it is not to somewhere or something else  
A rejoicing almost homesickness for right here, right now  

I want to eat mushrooms again  
And hear the breathing of the whole world with me  
As the hillside makes me real, in its living and dying rumbling chest, a breath in, and out  

Nowhere has my foot ever stepped  
But only flowers parted and twigs snapped under the weight  
Of calloused flesh and pressure moving  
Down long dusty trails beneath improbably tall pines  
All hushed in awe and then uproarious, as only lowland scrub forest can be  
With sweat rolling down dirty mosquito bitten shins  

And standing there vows pour forth unbidden  
To be exactly all of this in service to all of this forever  
Life living life, Life giving life  

I knelt down once in the middle of the woods  
Near a tree that had fallen and was rotting easily, without pressure of schedule or what next to do or be  
And I prayed to every gentle spirit that would hear me  
That I offered my heart in service to exactly this  
The whole of Life  
Crying out with sometimes words and sometimes stillness  
Unsure if this was dedication or rite  
But without gap, the whole of me, poured out  
And seamless as I stood there was a moment  
Where the world bent in an unexpected way  
My chest broke open  
My vision shifted whether in my head or from my eyes  
And there was something that I do not have a name for  
Something more than localizable to places real or unreal  
But she, and it was she, was green and brown and sky-blue and purple and bright and dark and sunlight and deep bottomless dark water  
And I said yes
