## Spilling Tea

Ro spills tea, and laments his failings. Myosho blames the gods. Setcho kicks over the hearth. Only Setcho sees clearly.

Kick over the tea hearth. Where will you find errors, who will you find to blame them on? Hearth overturned, tea spilled.

Moving past the scene, or zooming in and finding just one action - to kick over the tea hearth. Does not matter the context anymore, Setcho's foot, an imagined critique. Someone here imagining another.

To spur on revolution, to overturn the tea hearth, to upend the order, the given wisdom, the way of things. To put it not only in doubt but to break it, to cast it aside and let it fall away. A revolutionary act. To build a new world we must first overturn the old.

A common turn, to suggest that first we must overturn the world of our thinking. Perhaps. But we are not shaped by our thoughts so much as our thoughts express the shape we are molded to by circumstance. Wherever agency lies it is the shape of history that gives the outlines and boundaries of our thought until we reshape them or they are reshaped by experience, by activity. We cannot dive into our thinking and expect our thinking to change us. We change by doing, we change by what is done, and our thinking changes. The crux of the materialist turn, not one of base matter, but of the direction from which power and potency flows. Earth up, not heaven down. The truth is not somewhere in the middle. The stars fixed and unfixed are just Earth again, and it is best that we learn these earthy lessons here and now.
